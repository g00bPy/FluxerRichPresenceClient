**FluxerRichPresenceClient** is a sophisticated, standalone desktop utility designed specifically for [Fluxer](https://fluxer.app/). It bridges the gap between your local Windows environment and your Fluxer profile, providing a high-performance framework for automated activity tracking and visual status customization.

## 🚀 Why FluxerRichPresenceClient?

[Fluxer](https://fluxer.app/) is an incredible, rapidly growing platform for community interaction, but it currently lacks a native desktop framework for **Rich Presence (RP)**. Users often find themselves manually updating statuses or appearing "Offline" while deep in a gaming session or a coding sprint.

I built this client to provide a "Set it and Forget it" solution. Whether you are battling in a game, designing in Creative Cloud, or debugging in PyCharm, this client ensures your Fluxer community knows exactly what you're up to—complete with high-resolution emotes and real-time "Time Elapsed" counters.

## 🛡️ Architectural Transparency & Safety

To ensure account safety and platform integrity, it is important to understand exactly how FRPC operates:

* **Non-Invasive Architecture:** This application **does not modify, inject code into, or "mod" the Fluxer client** in any way. It runs as a completely independent "sidecar" process on your operating system.
* **Direct-to-Fluxer Only:** The application communicates strictly and directly with `api.fluxer.app` and the official Fluxer Gateway. **No data is ever sent to third-party servers or external services.**
* **Pure Status Automation:** The client's scope is purely limited to automating your **Custom Status message**. It uses official WebSocket (Gateway) and REST API protocols to keep your profile updated based on your local activity.
* **Local Token Security:** Your account token is handled exclusively within your local machine's secure environment and is never exposed to external network calls outside of official Fluxer endpoints.

## ✨ Core Feature Set

### 🔍 Smart Activity Engine
The heart of the client is a non-intrusive scanning engine. 
* **Worthy App Filter:** Automatically filters out system background noise (Windows services, telemetry, etc.) to only show "worthy" applications.
* **Smart Context Sensing:** For specific apps like **PyCharm**, **VS Code**, or **Chrome**, the client can read window titles to display exactly which project or video you are working on.
* **Priority System:** If multiple configured apps are running, the client uses a user-defined priority system to decide which one takes center stage.

### 🎨 Visual Emote Vault
This client introduces the first dedicated **Emote Picker** for Fluxer desktop users.
* **Direct API Sync:** Securely queries your server memberships to pull every custom emote available to your account.
* **Animated WebP Support:** Full support for animated emotes. Unlike standard implementations, this client uses a custom rendering engine to preserve aspect ratios, ensuring emotes are never squished or cropped.
* **Local Caching:** Stores and manages emote data locally to ensure lightning-fast load times and minimal API impact.

### ⚡ Performance Optimized
* **Asynchronous Architecture:** Built on `asyncio` and `websockets`, the client maintains a constant connection to the Fluxer Gateway with near-zero CPU overhead.
* **Smart Pacing:** Includes built-in rate-limit protection to ensure your account remains in good standing with Fluxer's infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

* **GUI Framework:** [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/) (Qt for Python)
* **Networking:** `websockets` for real-time Gateway communication.
* **Process Monitoring:** `psutil` for low-level system interaction.
* **Storage:** Windows Registry integration and secure local vaulting.
* **Image Handling:** `QtNetwork` and `QMovie` with WebP decoding.

## 📜 Development Note
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To maintain the security and integrity of the Fluxer ecosystem, specific encryption logic and registry vaulting functions are excluded from this public source. The provided code uses "Stubs" for these functions to demonstrate the application's structural logic while keeping the security implementation private.
